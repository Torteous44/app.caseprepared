# JWT Token Refresh Solution for Subscription Status

## Problem Solved

When users completed payment through Stripe, they encountered "402 Payment Required" errors when trying to access premium content, even though their payment was successful and subscription status was updated in the database.

### Root Cause
- JWT tokens contain subscription status at creation time
- Database updates from Stripe webhooks don't affect existing tokens
- Authentication reads from token, not database

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Token Refresh After Payment

**File: `src/pages/CheckoutSuccess.tsx`**
- Automatically refreshes JWT token after successful payment
- Fetches updated user profile with new subscription status
- Provides retry mechanism if refresh fails
- Shows clear loading and error states

### 2. Centralized Token Refresh Utility

**File: `src/utils/apiClient.ts`**
- `refreshTokenAndProfile()`: Refreshes token and updates user profile
- `shouldRefreshToken()`: Checks if token refresh is needed
- Can be used across the app for consistent token management

### 3. Automatic Retry on 402 Errors

**File: `src/utils/interviewService.ts`**
- Automatically attempts token refresh when 402 errors occur
- Retries API calls with new token
- Provides seamless user experience

### 4. Enhanced Auth Context

**File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
- Added `refreshSubscriptionStatus()` method
- Provides centralized subscription status management
- Available to all components via `useAuth()` hook

### 5. Proactive Subscription Status Refresh

**File: `src/pages/InterviewsPage.tsx`**
- Refreshes subscription status when users navigate to premium content
- Handles subscription errors gracefully
- Ensures users have latest subscription data

## Technical Flow

```
1. User completes Stripe payment
2. Redirected to /checkout/success with session_id
3. CheckoutSuccess component:
   - Waits 2 seconds for webhook processing
   - Calls refreshToken() to get new JWT with updated subscription status
   - Calls fetchUserProfile() to update local state
   - Shows success message with updated subscription status

4. If user tries to access premium content with old token:
   - API returns 402 Payment Required
   - interviewService automatically refreshes token
   - Retries API call with new token
   - User gets access to premium content
```

## Benefits

- **Seamless User Experience**: Users get immediate access after payment
- **Automatic Recovery**: System automatically handles token refresh on 402 errors
- **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
- **Centralized Management**: Consistent token refresh across the app
- **Clear User Feedback**: Loading states and error messages

## Testing

To test the solution:

1. Complete a Stripe payment
2. Verify you're redirected to success page
3. Check that token is refreshed and subscription status is updated
4. Try accessing premium content immediately
5. Verify no 402 errors occur

## Monitoring

The solution includes comprehensive logging:
- Token refresh attempts and results
- User profile update status
- 402 error handling and retry attempts
- All errors are logged for debugging

## Future Enhancements

- Add periodic token refresh for long sessions
- Implement token expiration warnings
- Add subscription status polling for real-time updates
- Consider implementing WebSocket for instant subscription updates
