      title: "A Comprehensive Guide to Case Interview Preparation",
      excerpt: "Discover the essential steps, frameworks, and mindset needed to excel in consulting case interviews.",
      content: `Case interviews are a cornerstone of the consulting recruitment process, testing not only your problem-solving skills but also your ability to structure and communicate complex ideas. A well-prepared candidate often stands out by demonstrating both analytical rigor and a polished, professional demeanor. Below is an in-depth overview of what you need to focus on to maximize your success.
  
  **1. Understand the Consulting Landscape**  
  Before diving into specific case interview strategies, take time to understand the consulting industry. Research major firms, their service lines, and their clients. Each consulting firm has unique expectations and cultural nuances, which can guide how you structure and present your case solutions.
  
  **2. Master Core Frameworks**  
  Familiarity with common business frameworks—like MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), Porter's Five Forces, and the 4Ps of Marketing—can help you dissect complex problems systematically. While you shouldn't rely on memorizing frameworks verbatim, having a mental library of approaches ensures you can pivot quickly when your case interviewer shifts focus or adds new data.
  
  **3. Practice Quantitative Analysis**  
  Case interviews often require mental math, market sizing, and interpreting data charts. Practice calculating percentages, break-even points, and compound annual growth rates (CAGR) without a calculator. This not only boosts your confidence but also demonstrates to interviewers that you can handle data under time constraints.
  
  **4. Develop Hypothesis-Driven Thinking**  
  Rather than passively gathering information, adopt a hypothesis-driven approach. Propose a possible explanation or solution early in the interview, then use each subsequent piece of data to refine or disprove it. This approach shows that you can think proactively—an essential trait in consulting engagements.
  
  **5. Refine Your Communication Skills**  
  Consultants must communicate complex ideas in a succinct, clear manner. During your case interview, maintain structured conversation, summarize your key points, and check in with the interviewer to confirm mutual understanding. Polished communication elevates your recommendations and strengthens your personal brand.
  
  **6. Seek Feedback and Iterate**  
  Improvement comes from consistent practice combined with actionable feedback. Whether it's from a professional coach, peers, or online platforms like Case Prepared, incorporate critiques into your process and track your growth over time.
  
  By balancing theory, deliberate practice, and confident delivery, you'll be well-positioned to tackle any case interview scenario. Armed with the right strategies and mindset, you can transform a daunting process into a rewarding opportunity to showcase your consulting aptitude.`,

      title: "Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Consulting Case Interviews",
      excerpt: "Learn the mistakes that most candidates make during case interviews—and how to sidestep them.",
      content: `Even top candidates can falter in consulting case interviews when faced with high-pressure scenarios and unexpected twists. By understanding the most frequent pitfalls, you can proactively avoid them and stand out for the right reasons.
  
  **1. Jumping Straight to Solutions**  
  It's tempting to propose solutions immediately, but thorough analysis matters. Spend time clarifying the problem and laying out a structured approach before narrowing your focus. Interviewers look for methodical thinking over hurried guesses.
  
  **2. Ignoring the MECE Principle**  
  A core consulting tool, the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle helps ensure you cover all critical areas without duplication. If your approach overlaps categories or omits key factors, you risk missing vital insights.
  
  **3. Poor Quantitative Handling**  
  When faced with charts, tables, or quick math questions, a lack of confidence can derail an otherwise solid performance. Brush up on mental math and practice interpreting data swiftly to avoid stumbling on essential details.
  
  **4. Weak Communication**  
  Consultants not only solve problems—they communicate solutions effectively to stakeholders. During the case interview, strive for clarity. Summarize key points, check for understanding, and adapt your communication style based on interviewer cues.
  
  **5. Neglecting Soft Skills**  
  Behavioral elements—such as active listening, body language, and rapport-building—count just as much as hard analytics. Stay engaged, maintain eye contact, and express enthusiasm for tackling complex business challenges.
  
  **6. Failing to Reflect on Feedback**  
  If you receive critical feedback or realize you misstepped in a practice session, take the time to dissect what went wrong. Adjust your frameworks or presentation style accordingly. Continuous improvement is the hallmark of a strong candidate.
  
  By anticipating these pitfalls, you can refine your problem-solving method and deliver structured, data-driven conclusions—all while projecting confidence and poise.`,

      title: "MECE Mastery: Structuring Case Interview Analyses",
      excerpt: "A deep dive into the MECE principle and how to use it to nail complex consulting problems.",
      content: `The MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle is a foundational tool in consulting, used to organize information so that no key elements overlap or are left out. Although it may appear straightforward, achieving a truly MECE approach under the pressure of a case interview requires practice, precision, and adaptability. Below, we delve into how to refine your MECE skills to add depth and clarity to your case analyses.

**1. Understanding the Core of MECE**  
- **Mutually Exclusive:** Each category or segment in your breakdown should stand on its own, with no overlap. This clarity prevents confusion, duplication of data, and contradictory insights.  
- **Collectively Exhaustive:** The sum of your categories should cover every relevant angle of the problem. This ensures you don't miss critical components that could derail your recommendations.

A quick litmus test for MECE is asking: "Is there any aspect of the problem that doesn't fit in these categories?" or "Do these categories inherently overlap?" Balancing both exclusivity and completeness can be tricky, but doing so effectively sets the stage for structured problem-solving.

**2. Applying MECE in High-Pressure Interviews**  
- **Clarify Scope:** Begin by asking pointed questions to confirm the problem boundaries. This might involve geographical reach, time horizon, or specific performance metrics. Clarifying scope early on helps ensure you capture all critical elements in your initial breakdown.  
- **Create Intuitive Categories:** Organize your data in a way that feels logical and coherent. For cost analysis, you might categorize by function (e.g., manufacturing, marketing, supply chain) or by cost type (fixed vs. variable), but avoid mixing both approaches within the same breakdown.  
- **Check for Gaps and Overlaps:** Periodically pause to reflect on whether each category is still logically distinct and whether your entire problem space is covered. Refining your categories mid-interview—when new information comes to light—is not just acceptable but expected.

**3. Best Practices and Pitfalls**  
- **Don't Overcomplicate:** Creating too many subcategories can turn your framework into a maze. Strike a balance between detail and clarity.  
- **Leverage Data:** If the interviewer provides quantitative or qualitative insights, use these to validate your categories. For instance, if the client's revenue is largely derived from two key products, it may be wise to focus your categories around these product lines, rather than an overly granular breakdown.  
- **Stay Flexible:** MECE is a guiding principle, not a rigid formula. Adapt your structure if the conversation shifts significantly.

**4. Practice Across Multiple Case Types**  
MECE isn't reserved for just one kind of business problem. Practice it in:  
- **Profitability Cases:** Categorize revenue and cost drivers to isolate the root cause of declining margins.  
- **Market Entry:** Structure your breakdown around market size, competitor landscape, and distribution channels, ensuring no overlap in your analysis.  
- **M&A Scenarios:** Consider strategic fit, financial synergy, and cultural integration in separate silos to maintain clarity.

Varying your practice ensures you're comfortable using MECE principles regardless of industry or case complexity.

**5. Communicate Your Structure Clearly**  
Express your thought process out loud as you build your MECE-based framework. This transparency not only helps the interviewer follow your reasoning but also demonstrates your capacity for clear, structured thinking—a hallmark of top consulting talent.

By rigorously applying and communicating the MECE principle, you set a strong foundation for any case interview analysis. Whether you're dissecting cost components, mapping out strategic priorities, or exploring new market opportunities, a MECE-aligned framework will help you remain focused, concise, and comprehensive. Master this skill, and you'll be well-positioned to stand out in competitive consulting interviews.`,

      title: "Advanced Case Interview Frameworks Beyond MECE",
      excerpt: "Explore lesser-known but powerful frameworks to tackle complex business problems during consulting interviews.",
      content: `While MECE is a critical principle, you'll often need additional frameworks and analytical tools to dissect complex business questions thoroughly. Below are some advanced frameworks that can help you excel in challenging case interviews. By understanding not just what these frameworks entail, but how and when to apply them, you'll be better positioned to provide actionable insights and impress your interviewer.

**1. Value Chain Analysis**  
This framework breaks down an organization's activities—both primary (e.g., operations, marketing, sales, logistics) and support (e.g., procurement, technology, human resources, firm infrastructure). By mapping these activities in detail, you can spot inefficiencies, cost-saving opportunities, or innovation potentials across each function. For instance, analyzing whether in-house production versus outsourcing could reduce costs or improve quality can be invaluable. It's also helpful in identifying ways to create and capture value, whether through product differentiation or operational excellence.

**2. Porter's Five Forces**  
Designed to assess industry competitiveness, Porter's Five Forces helps you analyze threats from new entrants, substitute products, buyer bargaining power, supplier bargaining power, and competitive rivalry. For market entry cases, understanding which forces are most influential can shape your client's expansion strategy. For competitive strategy or profitability issues, pinpointing how each force constrains or enables market power can offer key insights on pricing, product differentiation, and investment decisions.

**3. The Four Ps of Marketing**  
When dealing with product-related challenges—like a new launch or a struggling product—focusing on Product, Price, Place, and Promotion can clarify how a company should position its offerings. For instance, you might uncover that while a product meets consumer needs, the pricing model is misaligned with customer expectations, or that the brand's promotional channels don't effectively reach the target audience. Balancing these elements ensures comprehensive coverage of both tangible and intangible aspects of a product strategy.

**4. Profit Tree Analysis**  
Profit tree diagrams break down profitability by revenue and cost components, enabling a granular look at problem areas. This method is particularly handy in cases involving profit decline or cost overruns. By dissecting revenue into volume and price (and sometimes additional layers like product mix or customer segments) and costs into fixed and variable components, you can systematically pinpoint and quantify financial drivers. It also helps in structuring recommendations—such as volume growth initiatives, cost optimization, or price repositioning.

**5. Three Horizons of Growth**  
If a case interview revolves around long-term strategy, the Three Horizons model helps segment growth initiatives into immediate (Horizon 1), mid-term (Horizon 2), and long-term (Horizon 3) opportunities. Horizon 1 focuses on sustaining and growing the core business, Horizon 2 explores adjacent markets or emerging products, and Horizon 3 deals with transformative or disruptive innovations. It's a powerful way to demonstrate strategic thinking over multiple timeframes and to prioritize resource allocation accordingly.

**6. McKinsey's 7S Framework**  
The 7S framework (Strategy, Structure, Systems, Shared Values, Style, Staff, and Skills) is excellent for organizational and change management cases. It emphasizes that a company's performance hinges on the alignment of all seven elements. For instance, if a client's new strategy (one of the 7S) isn't supported by the existing systems or staff capabilities, execution is likely to falter. The framework shines in post-merger integrations or when analyzing large-scale restructuring initiatives.

**7. BCG Growth-Share Matrix**  
This classic matrix categorizes business units or products into four categories—Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs—based on market growth and market share. It's a straightforward yet powerful tool for portfolio analysis, helping companies decide where to invest, where to divest, and where to simply maintain the status quo. In case interviews where product or portfolio prioritization is key, the Growth-Share Matrix can offer a clear snapshot of strategic priorities.

**Combining Frameworks for Depth**  
While these frameworks are traditionally taught in isolation, top-performing candidates mix and match them to generate deeper insights. For instance, you might use a Value Chain Analysis to identify high-level operational inefficiencies, then apply Profit Tree Analysis to quantify their impact on profitability. Or combine Porter's Five Forces with a Three Horizons approach when evaluating a company's market entry strategy over different timelines.

By blending frameworks thoughtfully—and adapting them to the context of the case—you'll demonstrate the analytical versatility that top consulting firms seek. Always remember to communicate your reasoning clearly and logically, ensuring that your interviewer can follow each step of your problem-solving process. Ultimately, showcasing both a mastery of these frameworks and the strategic judgment to apply them effectively will set you apart.`,

      excerpt: "Learn how to structure your responses and showcase your interpersonal skills when facing behavioral questions.",
      content: `Consulting interviews aren't limited to solving business cases; they also evaluate your soft skills, leadership potential, and cultural fit. Behavioral questions often reveal how you handle team dynamics, conflicts, and high-stakes situations.
  
  **1. Expect Common Themes**  
  Behavioral questions typically revolve around teamwork, leadership, conflict resolution, failure, and success stories. For each theme, prepare one or two real-life examples that highlight key strengths like communication, adaptability, or resilience.
  
  **2. Use the STAR Method**  
  - **Situation:** Briefly describe the context.  
  - **Task:** Outline your specific responsibility or challenge.  
  - **Action:** Detail what you did to address the issue.  
  - **Result:** Explain the outcome, ideally quantifying your impact.
  
  This structured approach keeps your answer concise and focused on tangible outcomes, making it easier for interviewers to follow.
  
  **3. Reflect on Key Learnings**  
  Consultants thrive on continuous improvement. After presenting your story, summarize what you learned and how it shaped you. This demonstrates self-awareness and a growth mindset—attributes vital for success in client-facing roles.
  
  **4. Align with Firm Values**  
  Research your target consulting firm's values and culture. If collaboration is a major focus, choose examples that showcase teamwork. If innovation is prized, highlight situations where you proposed creative solutions under pressure.
  
  **5. Practice, But Stay Authentic**  
  While preparation is crucial, avoid memorizing scripted answers. Interviewers value genuine responses and can detect overly polished narratives. Instead, internalize the STAR framework and key talking points so you can adapt them naturally.
  
  By combining solid case-solving abilities with compelling behavioral stories, you'll position yourself as a well-rounded candidate ready to navigate the high demands of consulting life.`,

      content: `Not all consulting case interviews follow the same format. Some focus on market sizing, while others dive into growth strategies or M&A scenarios. Understanding the unique nuances of these specialized cases can make or break your interview performance.
  
  **1. Market Sizing**  
  - **Approach:** Start by clarifying the customer segment, geography, and any constraints. Then use top-down or bottom-up methods to calculate the market size.  
  - **Key Skills:** Quick math, logical assumptions, and clear presentation of thought process.  
  - **Common Mistakes:** Inconsistent assumptions, overlooking critical segments, or ignoring potential growth factors.
  
  **2. Growth Strategy**  
  - **Approach:** Identify core revenue drivers, potential new markets or product lines, and assess internal vs. external expansion options.  
  - **Key Skills:** Combining frameworks like the 4Ps with creative thinking to propose practical growth levers.  
  - **Common Mistakes:** Lack of prioritization among growth options or ignoring resource constraints.
  
  **3. Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)**  
  - **Approach:** Evaluate strategic fit, synergies (revenue and cost), deal structure, and potential risks.  
  - **Key Skills:** Financial acumen, understanding synergy realization, and awareness of cultural integration challenges.  
  - **Common Mistakes:** Focusing solely on financials while neglecting operational alignment or integration complexities.
  
  **4. Operations Improvement**  
  - **Approach:** Pinpoint the bottlenecks in the value chain—be it procurement, production, logistics, or after-sales. Apply lean principles or cost-analysis frameworks to propose efficiency measures.  
  - **Key Skills:** Familiarity with operational KPIs, root-cause analysis, and process redesign.  
  - **Common Mistakes:** Over-simplifying operational issues or failing to factor in change management efforts.

      content: `When it comes to case interview preparation, nothing beats consistent, high-quality practice. But finding a wide variety of structured prompts is easier said than done—especially if you're prepping late at night, between classes, or juggling job applications. That's why we built the **CasePrepared AI-generated case prompt library**: to help candidates access unlimited case prompts with just one click.

## Why Case Volume Matters in Consulting Prep

Top consulting firms like McKinsey, Bain, and BCG are looking for candidates who can think clearly under pressure, structure ambiguous problems, and communicate with polish. And those skills aren't developed overnight. They're developed through **repetition**—lots of it.

Doing 1 or 2 cases a week might feel productive, but it's often not enough to build muscle memory. To truly internalize structure, synthesis, and speed, you need volume: 30, 40, even 60+ cases across different industries and question types. The problem? Most free resources online are either outdated, repetitive, or locked behind paywalls. Peer groups often recycle the same 5 cases, and PDF libraries don't give you practice diversity.

## Enter: CasePrepared's AI-Generated Case Prompt Engine

Our generator was built with a single goal in mind: give you *endless, realistic, and varied* prompts you can start practicing immediately. By combining industry tags, case types, and difficulty levels, CasePrepared creates prompts that simulate real interviews in sectors like:
- Consumer goods
- Healthcare
- Tech
- Private equity
- Public sector

Each prompt includes clear framing, realistic constraints, and a prompt that guides your structure. We designed the system based on input from former MBB interviewers and recruiters, ensuring that the tone and content match real interviews.

Each row includes:
- Prompt text
- Industry
- Case type (profitability, market entry, M&A, etc.)
- Estimated difficulty

You can sort by topic, warm up with easy ones, or dive into unfamiliar sectors to expand your range. It's the fastest way to prep smart—no scheduling required.

## Preview the Experience Inside CasePrepared

      title: "AI Case Interview Feedback: 5 Structure Errors Our Evaluator Catches | CasePrepared",
      excerpt: "Discover how CasePrepared's AI evaluator gives instant, accurate feedback on case interview structure—faster than any peer.",
      content: `Most candidates prepping for consulting interviews have one major blind spot: structure. You might be brilliant at math and analysis, but if your case structure is shaky—missing MECE logic, skipping guide steps, or jumping to conclusions—you're leaving points on the table.

At CasePrepared, we built our **AI case interview feedback** system to solve this exact problem. Our AI doesn't just simulate a case; it listens, analyzes, and gives detailed feedback on your structure and logic—immediately.

## Why Structure Matters More Than You Think

In most MBB interviews, the first 60 seconds of your case response determines how your interviewer perceives your thinking. Are you organized? Are you confident? Do you have a clear plan for solving the problem? If your structure is scattered or incomplete, it's incredibly difficult to recover—even if your analysis is solid.

Unfortunately, most mock partners don't catch subtle structural flaws. They might miss that you didn't bucket costs properly. Or that your issue tree wasn't MECE. That's why so many candidates plateau even after dozens of practice sessions.

## CasePrepared Evaluator: Trained to Catch What You Miss

Our AI evaluator is built around a four-part rubric used by real consulting interviewers:
1. **Structure** – Did you segment the problem clearly and logically?
2. **Analysis** – Did you apply frameworks effectively?
3. **Communication** – Was your response organized and concise?
4. **Synthesis** – Did you summarize insights and recommend next steps?

Let's focus on the **Structure** component—because it's where the majority of candidates make the most avoidable mistakes.

Here are five structural errors the CasePrepared AI consistently flags:
- **Missing a revenue/cost breakdown** when asked to diagnose a profitability issue  
- **Lacking MECE logic** (e.g. overlapping or unclear buckets) in your issue tree  
- **Jumping to a framework** without first clarifying the objective and context  
- **Using generic buckets** (e.g. "marketing, operations, strategy") without tailoring  
- **Skipping a recap** of the structure before analysis, losing clarity

## Instant, Unbiased Feedback—Every Time

After each response, the AI gives you a score and a short rationale. It highlights where structure was weak or incomplete and suggests what should have been added. The feedback is instant—usually in under 600 milliseconds—so you can immediately do another round and improve on the spot.

That kind of fast iteration is what makes top candidates improve so quickly. You don't need to book another peer mock or wait for coaching feedback. You can self-correct in the moment and build true pattern recognition.

> "The evaluator flagged that I was missing segmentation on costs—and I'd never realized it."  
> "It told me I wasn't being MECE in my buckets, which no one else had ever called out."

      title: "Case Interview Keyword List: Free Cheat-Sheet from CasePrepared | CasePrepared",
      excerpt: "Download our case interview keyword list and see how CasePrepared uses it to boost your feedback score.",
      content: `In a real consulting interview, you're evaluated on logic, clarity, and insight. But with AI-based prep tools like CasePrepared, **keywords** matter, too—because they serve as proxies for structured thinking.

That's why we built our internal **case interview keyword list** to power CasePrepared's real-time feedback engine. This isn't just a list of buzzwords—it's a carefully structured taxonomy of revenue and cost levers, framed to match how elite consultants think, speak, and write.

## Why Keywords Matter in AI Feedback

Let's be clear: CasePrepared doesn't blindly score based on keywords. But smart keyword recognition is a core part of how our AI detects whether you're addressing all key components of a case.

When you're solving a profitability case, for example, we're checking for references to:
- **Revenue = Price × Volume**
- Segmentation: by **customer**, **region**, or **product line**
- Fixed vs **variable costs**
- **Capacity**, **utilization**, and **margins**

These aren't just arbitrary labels. They're the language of consultants—and they signal a structured approach to any business problem.

If you skip them entirely, the AI may correctly infer that your structure is underdeveloped.

## What's Inside the Cheat-Sheet?

We categorize keywords by topic. You'll get:
- **Revenue Drivers**: pricing strategies, volume levers, demand-side language
- **Cost Buckets**: fixed vs variable, direct vs indirect, labor/materials/utilities
- **Market Entry Terms**: barriers, distribution, regulatory, competitive landscape
- **M&A-Specific Phrases**: synergies, integration, valuation
- **Synthesis Signals**: key takeaway, client recommendation, next steps

Plus: 10 bonus MECE bucket examples for practice.

## How the AI Uses It

When you upload a prompt or start a mock in CasePrepared, the evaluator listens to your spoken answer, transcribes it, and checks for structural alignment and concept coverage.

One way it does this is by using the keyword list as a mental checklist. Did you mention cost segmentation? Did you identify customer churn in a growth problem? Did you tie back to profitability metrics?

It's not about keyword stuffing—it's about using the right terminology at the right moment.

> "The keyword sheet taught me to actually say things like 'customer acquisition cost' out loud."  
> "I didn't realize I was skipping fixed/variable segmentation until I saw my feedback score."

## Learn It, Practice It, Score Higher

Here's how to use the keyword list in your prep routine:
1. **Review** the keywords by case type (profitability, growth, M&A, etc.)
2. **Incorporate** them into your mental case structures
3. **Use them naturally** during CasePrepared sessions
4. **Review feedback** and identify what you missed
5. **Repeat** until it becomes second nature

You can also add keywords to your personal prep notes and upload them to CasePrepared for prompt-matching. It's a powerful way to ensure you're practicing the way you'll be scored.

## Start Structuring Smarter

Consulting interviews are about clarity. Structure. Precision. The CasePrepared keyword list helps you build all three.

Structure is more than a framework—it's the words you use to express it. Make them count.`,

      excerpt: "Learn how to build your own AI case interview bot—and why most serious candidates still choose CasePrepared.",
      content: `The rise of AI tools has sparked a wave of DIY experimentation. If you've ever wondered whether you could build your own AI case interview bot using tools like OpenAI, Zapier, and Google Sheets—you can. In fact, we'll show you how.

But we'll also show you why most users still come back to **CasePrepared**, the purpose-built platform that goes far beyond what any no-code stack can offer.

## Yes, You Can Build Your Own Bot

Let's start with what's possible. Using a combination of GPT APIs and basic automation tools, you can wire up a lightweight system that does something like this:
1. You input a case prompt into a Google Sheet.
2. Zapier sends that prompt to OpenAI's API.
3. OpenAI responds with case questions or feedback.
4. Responses get logged back into your spreadsheet or chat app.

Congrats—you've built a basic **AI case interview bot**.

## But Here's What Goes Wrong Fast

What sounds good in theory quickly becomes a patchwork in practice. Our team spent weeks testing and comparing DIY setups with CasePrepared's production system. Here are the most common issues:

- **Latency**: Each API call introduces lag. Conversations don't feel live, which kills the interview simulation.
- **Prompt Bloat**: The quality of output depends entirely on how well you engineer prompts. Most DIY bots suffer from over-engineered, inconsistent responses.
- **No Voice Feedback**: Most setups can't handle spoken answers, so you lose the realism of thinking on your feet.
- **Scoring Rubric? Not Really**: You'll need to build your own structure evaluation logic or hardcode keywords. That's a lot of work—and it's rarely accurate.
- **Maintenance Overload**: Every tweak means touching 3+ tools, monitoring API limits, and dealing with versioning issues.

> "I tried the no-code route first. It was a fun experiment, but the experience didn't come close to CasePrepared."  
> "Once I needed real-time voice feedback and proper evaluation, I switched over. Haven't looked back."

## What CasePrepared Gets Right

CasePrepared was designed from the ground up for case prep. It's not a chatbot—it's a coach.

- **Voice-based interaction**: Just like a real interviewer, you speak and get feedback.
- **Structured scoring**: Based on the S1–S4 rubric used by elite firms.
- **Prompt diversity**: 500+ AI-generated cases across industries, case types, and difficulty levels.
- **Instant feedback**: Evaluate structure, math, synthesis, and communication within seconds.
- **Zero maintenance**: No API keys, no broken zaps, no spreadsheets.

If you want to tinker and learn how AI bots work, we encourage it. In fact, we've open-sourced our **case JSON schema** so you can build your own custom prompts:
🔧 [**Clone our schema on GitHub**](https://github.com/caseprepared/case-schema)

But if you're serious about getting into McKinsey, BCG, Bain, or top-tier firms, why reinvent the wheel?

## Build If You Must—But Prep Like a Pro

Building your own bot can be a great learning experience. But when the interview is two weeks away and you need quality reps, time is better spent practicing—not debugging.
